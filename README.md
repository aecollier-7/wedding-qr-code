Abby + Caroline's wedding creosote. 

Ingredients: sunflower oil infused with creosote leaves, beeswax.

Creosote is a magical desert plant. We love it primarily for its wet pavement, just rained in the desert scent, but it's also has antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties!
I find it particularly useful on fresh mosquito bites - they're gone the next day when I use it right away.
A keepsake for Tucson and our wedding day!
